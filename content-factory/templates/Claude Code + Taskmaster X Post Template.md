# Claude Code + Taskmaster X Post Template

When creating X posts about Claude Code + Taskmaster workflow:

## Tone & Style
- Start with a problem/challenge (e.g., 'Cursor agents don't share context')
- Casual, conversational tone ('lol', 'fair warning', '@me')
- Self-deprecating humor ('it's messy but it ships ðŸš€')
- Focus on practical value over promotion

## Structure Template
1. Hook: Recent problem/discovery
2. Solution: What changed (Claude Code as orchestrator)
3. Breakdown: 2-3 key commands with bullet points
4. Value prop: What the repo contains
5. Call-out: Community engagement ('if anyone figures out...')

## Key Technical Points to Highlight
- /project-setup: PRD â†’ tasks â†’ Linear sync with metadata
- /execute-tasks: Multi-agent execution with shared context
- Anti-hallucination through metadata storage
- Session memory persistence across agents
- MCPs used: Taskmaster, Linear, Context7, Playwright

## What to Include in Repo
- Full 891-line workflow document (claude-code-taskmaster-workflow.md)
- Custom slash command implementations (.claude/commands/)
- Utility functions (linear-sync-utils.md)
- Setup instructions with MCP configuration

## What to Avoid
- Too much technical detail in the post
- Newsletter-style formatting
- Overwhelming with line counts or metrics
- Guru-speak or overselling
